/**
 *      Question 1_3 - 
 *          URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
            has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
            length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
            perform this operation in place.)
            
            Idea - Use a priority queue of size = string_size - true_length
            and insert characters in the queue from the back
